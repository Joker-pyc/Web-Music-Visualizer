# Web-Music-Visualizer-
A music Visualizer for web

The Particle Effect Music Visualizer is a web-based application that provides an immersive and dynamic visualization of music through mesmerizing particle animations. This visualizer allows users to select their favorite music files and experience an interactive display of particles that move and respond to the beats and rhythms of the music.

**Usage Instructions:**

1. **Getting Started:**
   - Clone or download the project to your local machine.

2. **Select Music:**
   - Click on the "Choose Music" button or label to open your file explorer.
   - Select an audio file (e.g., MP3, WAV) from your local machine.
   - The visualizer will automatically start playing the selected music and display the particle animation.

3. **Play/Pause Music:**
   - Once the music is loaded, you can control playback by clicking or tapping the "Play/Pause" button.
   - Clicking the button will toggle between playing and pausing the music.

4. **Fullscreen Mode:**

   - This will expand the visualizer to fill your entire screen.

5. **Particle Animation:**
   - The visualizer generates an animation of colorful particles that move in a circular pattern around the center of the screen.
   - The particles' movement and colors are synchronized with the music's beats, creating a dynamic and engaging display.

6. **Beat Detection:**
   - The visualizer employs beat detection to trigger special particle effects when a beat occurs in the music.
   - The beats are visualized as additional particles that momentarily appear on the screen.

7. **Now Playing Label:**
   - After selecting a music file, a "Now Playing" label will briefly appear in the top right corner, showing the name of the currently playing music.
